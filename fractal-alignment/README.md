# Fractal Alignment

A Pine Script v6 indicator for TradingView. It finds Fractal Model setups (C1 → C2 sweep and reclaim, confirmed by a lower-timeframe CISD) on a higher timeframe, draws them on the chart, and shows the higher-timeframe candles to the right of price. No library imports: everything runs inside the script.

## Install

Paste [fractal_alignment.pine](fractal_alignment.pine) into the Pine Editor, save, and add it to a chart.

## Model

The indicator picks a **model HTF** from the chart timeframe (`Fractal: Automatic`):

| Chart | Model HTF |
|---|---|
| 1s / 15s | 1m / 5m |
| 1m | 15m |
| 3m | 30m |
| 5m | 1H |
| 15m / 30m | 4H |
| 1H | Daily |
| 4H | Weekly |
| Daily | Monthly |
| Weekly | 3 Monthly |
| Monthly | 12 Monthly |

Other timeframes (2m, 45m, 2H, 3H, 8H, 12H, 2D…) have no model; only the HTF 1 / HTF 2 blocks are drawn.

Manual choices: `1s-1m, 15s-5m, 1m-15m, 3m-30m, 5m-1H, 15m-4H, 1H-1D, 4H-1W, 1D-1M` and `Custom`. The `C2 / C3 / C4` boxes choose the model types:

- **C2 model:** C2 takes C1's high / low and closes back inside.
- **C3 model:** C2 does not close back inside; C3 closes beyond C2's body without taking C2's extreme.
- **C4:** the continuation (its T-Spot).

A model is drawn only once its **CISD** on the entry timeframe confirms. **History** sets how many earlier setups stay drawn next to the latest one (0 = only the latest). **Bias:** Neutral, Bullish, Bearish, or **Auto Bias 1 / 2** (only setups in the direction of the model one / two fractals higher while it runs; on 5m-1H: AB1 = 15m-4H, AB2 = 1H-1D).

On the chart:

- **C2 / C3 label** at the swing; `C2+PSP` when the candle colors diverge from a correlated pair.
- **T-Spot (C3 / C4):** between the previous HTF candle's equilibrium (EQ) and the current candle's open, growing bar by bar, with the EQ as a dotted line. The C3 box keeps only the part that overlaps the CISD zone (the CISD level to the middle of the bodies of the run that made it), when they overlap. `C4` at the start of the C4 box.
- **CISD line:** ends one candle after the close through the level. **Early C2 CISD** (off by default): a CISD before C2 closes, dotted.
- **Candle 1 Sweep:** from the C1 extreme that C2 took to the end of C2.
- **Protected Swings:** continuations after the CISD. The swing must reach a point of interest (a fair value gap in the setup's direction, or an untaken swing it sweeps), then price closes through the opposite candles that led into it. A dot on the swing and a short line at the level; the dot turns gray once price takes the swing back.
- **Formation Liquidity:** the model's targets, the high (bullish) or low (bearish) of C1 and of the candle before it. A line ends at the bar that takes it.
- **SD projections** (off by default): multiples of the CISD ↔ C2 extreme range.
- **XC2:** price closes beyond the C2 extreme (red in C3, orange later; the model's SMT goes with it). **XC4:** C2 models only; during C4 price trades through C3's opposite extreme. **XC Labels** (on the Show Labels? row, on by default): turn it off and a failed model leaves no XC2 / XC3 / XC4 label; everything else stays.

## HTF candles

- **Model HTF block** (1H on a 5m chart): 4–40 candles, size (Small / Normal / Large), offset. White / black candles, packed close together.
- **HTF 1 / HTF 2** (off by default): extra blocks to the right. Auto = one and two steps above the model HTF (15m, 1H, 4H, D, W, M), or pick 15m, 30m, 1H, 90m, 4H, 6H, 7H, D, W, M; Auto never picks 90m, 6H or 7H. They show Previous EQ, sweeps, SMT and PSP; no model runs on them. They also show with Hide? on (Hide? only hides the model block) and on timeframes without a fractal (45m, 2H, 7H…), where Auto counts from the chart (7H: D / W). Each has its own candle count (the box next to its timeframe, 1 to 10, default 4); HTF Candles is only for the model block (at least 4).
- **HTF Label + Remaining Time** above each block by default (`Bottom` or `Both` to change): the timeframe in bold, the time left in brackets under it, e.g. `1H` / `(12:40)`.
- **HTF Open** and **Previous EQ** on the chart, on the HTF candles, or both. **L/H Lines** (off by default). **Time Labels** under each candle (on by default): open time, the day name on daily, the week's Monday date on weekly (`NOV 2`), the month on monthly.
- **Live sweep:** when the forming candle takes the previous candle's extreme and trades back inside.
- **SMT** between consecutive HTF candles, including the forming one; hidden once a newer candle trades beyond it.
- **Hide Setups?** hides every model drawing and model alert; the HTF candles stay.

## Asset Correlation (SMT + PSP)

- Two pairs, automatic, from the chart's own broker:
  - Futures: NQ ↔ ES + YM, ES ↔ NQ + YM, YM / RTY ↔ ES + NQ, GC ↔ XAUEUR + XAUGBP, SI ↔ XAGEUR + XAGGBP, CL ↔ RB + HO, HO ↔ CL + RB, RB ↔ CL + HO, BTC ↔ ETH (micros too). A dated contract (NQZ2026) pairs with the same contract (ESZ2026).
  - CFD / forex: US100 ↔ US500 + US30, US500 ↔ US100 + US30, US30 ↔ US500 + US100, XAUUSD ↔ XAUEUR + XAUGBP, XAGUSD ↔ XAGEUR + XAGGBP, EURUSD ↔ GBPUSD, AUDUSD ↔ NZDUSD, USDJPY / USDCHF / USDCAD, USOIL ↔ GASOLINEF + HEATINGOILF.
  - Crypto: BTCUSDT ↔ ETHUSDT (also `.P` perpetuals and BTCUSD ↔ ETHUSD).
  - `Custom`: two symbols by hand, each with `Inverse?` (e.g. DXY).
- **SMT on the chart** belongs to a setup: **reversal** from the C1 extreme to the C2 extreme, and **continuation** after C2 closes (a pair goes beyond its own C2 extreme while price does not; the line's end follows price). The label names the pair.
- **SMT colors:** two swatches on the `SMT Line` row: bullish SMT (blue) and bearish SMT (red), for the lines and pair names on the chart and on every HTF block.
- **PSP:** C1 and / or C2 close a different color than the pair's same candle (`Candle 1 / Candle 2 / Both`).

## Time Filter (off by default)

New setups only when the model is found inside a checked window (when C3 opens, or C4 for a C3 model), on charts below `Apply below` (1H). Three windows, New York time unless a UTC offset is set: 02:00–05:00, 08:00–11:00, 13:30–16:15, all unchecked by default (no window checked = nothing filtered).

## Info Table and ADR

```
   NQ1! (5m)
 5m-1H Model
   00:24:13
Bias: Neutral
SMT (Auto): ES1!, YM1!
  ADR 245.5 · 62%
```

One column; each row can be turned off. **ADR · CDR %** is on by default, the date off. Style `Text` (default) is text only with no background; `Table` adds a background. `Border?` adds a frame.

- **ADR:** average high-low of the last 14 completed days (today excluded); pips on forex, points elsewhere. The day starts 18:00 New York (forex 17:00) on every broker.
- **CDR:** today's range so far as a share of ADR.
- **ADR+ / ADR- lines** (off by default): today's low + ADR, today's high − ADR.

## Alerts

**Alerts Settings** at the top: the master switch **Alerts?**, then **Model Candles?** (Candle 2 / 3 / 4 and CISD Confirmed), **Early CISD?**, **SMT Divergence?**, **Protected Swings?**. To create one: the indicator's menu (three dots next to its name) → Add alert, condition **Any alert() function call**. Every alert message ends with the symbol and the fractal (`... on NAS100, 15m-4H`). An alert keeps the settings it was created with; after changing them, create it again. The dialog also lists separate conditions: **Bullish / Bearish C2/C3 Closure** (the HTF candle closed and formed a model, its CISD has not come yet; only in this list, not in Any alert() function call), Bullish / Bearish CISD Confirmed, Bullish / Bearish Early CISD.

## Other

- **Warnings** (on by default; nothing shows while all is fine): a short message when the chart timeframe does not fit the fractal or a pair has no data.
- **Calculated bars** (2000, TradingView's own setting): the first fifth (at most 500) warms up the HTF candles; the model runs on the rest. Lower it for speed, raise it to see further back.

## Colors and dark theme

One soft gray palette (TradingView's own grays) with blue / red for bullish / bearish. On a dark chart background, colors left at their default (bear body, borders, wicks, C1 sweep, block titles, C labels, table background) switch to light tones automatically; a color you pick yourself is kept.

## Concepts

- **C1 / C2 / C3 / C4:** C1 is the reference candle, C2 the sweep / reclaim candle, C3 and C4 the follow-through. Bullish C2: low < C1 low and close > C1 low. Bearish C2: high > C1 high and close < C1 high.
- **CISD (Change in State of Delivery):** on the entry timeframe, a close through the open of the last run of opposite candles that led into the sweep.
- **Protected swing:** the extreme behind the CISD; the setup holds while price does not take it back.
- **Equilibrium (EQ):** the middle of a candle.
- **PSP (Precision Swing Point):** C1 or C2 closes a different color than the correlated pair's same candle.
- **SMT:** one of two correlated instruments takes the previous extreme and the other does not.
